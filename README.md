# Rent My Ride Reactjs

## Description

Rent My Ride is a simple Fullstack MERN APP that makes it easy to rent, post, or return a bike in your community.

## User Story

AS A bike owner I want my bike to be idle as seldom as possible.

AS A bike rider I want access to a bike without having to own/store my own bike.

When I create an account and login, my password is encrypted and I am redirected to the home page.

I can post a bike for rent, rent a bike, and view my transaction history.

When I want to rent a bike, I can view and sort available bikes by model, location, price, color, and
number of wheels.

When I select a bike to rent, I am redirected to my Accounts where I can see my rental.
